The **Network Scan** project is a Python-based tool that scans the local network to discover devices connected to your server/system. The tool provides detailed information about the devices, such as their IP addresses, MAC addresses, and hostnames (if available). This project utilizes Python libraries to automate the scanning process and display the results.
